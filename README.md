# Mongo DB SSL Pipeline Example	
This project is an example of how to connect an application running on a Kubernetes to a [MongoDB instance hosted on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/databases-for-mongodb). 

* In this example we will learn how to create a MongoDB instance
* Generate credentials for connecting to that instance
* Add a SSL Certificate to our pipeline
* Securely store connection information within Kubernetes
